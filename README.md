Error Handling: 
The Post App boasts robust error handling capabilities to ensure a seamless experience for users. It effectively addresses three critical error types:

-   Server Connection: In the event of server connection issues, the app employs appropriate error messages and graceful error handling techniques. Users are informed about the problem and guided on how to proceed, ensuring they are aware of any temporary disruptions.
    
-   Internet Connection: When users encounter internet connection problems, the app proactively detects and notifies them. By displaying user-friendly messages, it guides users to troubleshoot the issue, providing assistance for re-establishing a stable internet connection.
    
-   Cached Data Connection: The app employs intelligent caching mechanisms to ensure smooth functionality even in offline scenarios. When a user loses connectivity, the app seamlessly switches to cached data, allowing users to continue browsing through previously fetched posts until the connection is restored.

Customization: 
To enhance the user experience, the Post App offers the following customization options:

-   Dark Mode: Users can switch to a dark mode theme, providing a visually pleasing and comfortable experience in low-light environments. Dark mode reduces eye strain and conserves battery life on devices with OLED screens.
